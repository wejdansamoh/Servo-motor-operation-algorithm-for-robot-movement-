to applying servo motors in walking Robot first we need to coordinate the movements of multiple servos to simulate walking. This involves defining the steps and synchronizing the movements of the legs , then disgne by using Design simulation software .
next step , we need Materials
1-Servo motors
2-Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) 3- Power source
4-Wires , connectors
Robot chassis and legs . 
then setup and Connect Servos
Mount the servo motors on the robot chassis.
Connect the servo motors to the microcontroller, ensuring each servo is connected to a dedicated PWM pin.
Start with a simple program to test individual servo motor control. Here's an example using Arduino . 
Define how the robot will Walk .
last test the robot's walking motion and make necessary adjustments
